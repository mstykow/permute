# String Permutations

This is an algorithm programming exercise in which a string composed of unique letters is permuted in all possible ways. Along the way we experiment with recursive vs. non-recursive implementations.

The exercise comes page 54 of Gayle Laakmann McDowell's (*Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Questions and Solutions* (5th edition))[https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X].
